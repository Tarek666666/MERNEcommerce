# Summary:

This web application was purposefully developed using vanilla JavaScript and the Pug template engine as a challenge. By using these technologies, the app was built from scratch without the use of external libraries or frameworks.

The application enables the user to log in as an admin, allowing them to add, update, and delete new products. Additionally, the admin can perform the same 
actions as a regular user by adding items to their own cart. The cart automatically performs all necessary calculations and 
prepares the total price for checkout.
The app utilizes a free MySQL Database (ClearDB) hosted on Heroku to store all product data.
